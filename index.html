                <h1>Sova</h1>
                <p>Born from the eternal winter of Russia's tundra, Sova tracks, finds, and eliminates enemies with ruthless efficiency and precision. His custom bow and incredible scouting abilities ensure that even if you run, you cannot hide. Sova has a very calm and level-headed personality. Although he is incredibly dedicated and ruthless towards the enemies, he is warm towards his teammates, always encouraging and complimenting them. He believes in himself and he believes in his team to win. His steadiness and tirelessness on the field is most likely an asset to the morale of the team.</p>
