# The-Sova-project
An interesting webpage about a Valorant agent that I built while learning frontend web development. 
I followed the odin project while learning frontend web dev and this was a project in that course. We had to make a cool webpage using skills we learnt in HTML and CSS. Most of this involves working with flexbox as of now.
